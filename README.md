# TodayWasAGoodDay
A simple twitter bot that tweets today was a good day if the White Sox win and the Cubs lose

## Implementation
This bot was made using a python script that runs daily using www.pythonanywhere.com

## Creating your own bot
Feel free to use this as a template for you own twitter bot. I used mlbgame which is an mlb api to see the results of the games. Its documentation can be found at http://panz.io/mlbgame/. I also used tweepy as a twitter api.
